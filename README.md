This is repo to imprint my journey in learning devops technologies

                 Welcome to the Boilled-Spaghetti learning Journey
                        Learn like a fool, learn like me.

This method is called Boilled-Spaghetti because that is the nickname i gave myself many
years ago because i honestly thought that a boilled-spaghettti is cleverer than me.
I still do.

So after i realised that i forget everything i learn after some time i think that the time has come to somehow imprint the things i learn. Also as i am currently looking for a job i need to somehow show people what i know and how i understand it.
This could be very easily done with a devops project, but in order for me to learn better
i need to write down everything i learn each time i use a tool.
Through the years I have found out that i am good in notetaking.
SO, i will try to write down anything i learn in a Github repo(in order to learn git as well.

During this process I want to make simple projects as well.

I will revisiting everything i have learnt and start taking notes for each topic
- linux
- docker
- kubernetes
- ansible
- jenkins
- git
- ...

This is a need that I have because everytime i learn somthing and I start a new topic
I realise that after some days i dont remember the previous topic.

It is highly posible that even now that i am doing this notetaking thing, will continue to forget everything i
learn but now i will have a personall knowledge base to search for a topic.

Also sometimes when i read my previous studies i find myself amazed by how clever i was
back then. So now I will become a past genious.

I have many many times failed to learn many topics that i wanted to learn at that time.
This includes frontend, backend, django, hacking and many more, but i have never used this note taking technic.

The idea for this came from a youtube guy( The portait of a geek - Gerasimos ) and a twich/youtube guy ( rwxrob - rob ). Gerasimos is a great supporter o blogging and sharing the
journey of learning online, and Rob is a great supporter of zettlekasten notetaking. I am
sure that i will disappoint both in the way but my goal is not to make them proud. My goal is to make my one way of learning online.

This method is now called the bs-way (boilled-spaghegti)-way.
